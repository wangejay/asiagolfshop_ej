== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Will this plugin work for themes other than Storefront?**
Unfortunately, No. This plugin was designed to work for the Storefront theme, utilizing Storefront's action hooks and filters. Activating the plugin while using a different theme will trigger a warning.

**I've activated the plugin, where can I access the settings?**
The settings for this plugin can be found in the Customizer page under Appearance. In that page, find the section named "Branding".

**I've already added a logo using Jetpack. Will my logo in Jetpack be removed?**
If you've added a logo using jetpack, your logo will still be displayed on the site. If you want to use this plugin instead of jetpack, just upload your logo and make sure to check Logo image as the branding style. The logo you've uploaded on Jetpack will then be ignored to avoid conflict.

**What is the maximum width and height for my logo?**
The maximum width displayed for the logo is 213 pixels. If your image is bigger than this, it will automatically resize. Just make sure that the width it is not less than 213 pixels to avoid stretching the image.
